##How to use this implementation
This code was written in `Python 3.4.3`.

The `tira` function of `main.py` executes the algorithm, have a look at the comments over there.

`main.py`

* `NUMBER_ELIMINATE_FEATURES` determines the number of features to be eliminated from each extreme (max/min +/-) 
* `NUMBER_ITERATIONS` to determines the number of iterations to be made. 
 
`unmasking.py`
 
 * `CHUNK_LENGTH` determines how long each chunk will be
 * `INITIAL_FEATURE_SET_LENGTH` determines how many words will be considered in the initial feature set
